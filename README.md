Develop a Rule Based System using CLIPS Job Role Recommendation System
1. Domain:
The domain of this project is Education and Career Services
2. Variables:
The inputs of this system are:
User Domain: The domain in which the user has worked/is proficient in. User Experience: The number of years for which the user has worked for. The output of this system are:
Job roles that are suitable for the user as per the inputs entered.
List of skills that are required to excel in that particular domain.
3. What your AI system is doing:
This AI system simply takes the input as the domain of the user as well as the duration of experience and returns the job roles that are suitable for the user.
It also provides the list of skills that are required to excel in that particular domain.
1. The project begins by asking the name and greeting the user.
2. Then it asks the user to select the domain by entering a number between 1 to 5.
3. Further, it goes ahead and asks the user about the number of years of
experience in that domain. The user must select the appropriate choice by
selecting a number between 1 to 5.
4. After making the correct selections, the user will get a few job roles as the
response.
5. Another response will be the list of skills that a user must have to excel in that
particular domain.
This system can be enhanced by including a number of parameters such as Graduation status, Majors, subjects, interests and many other things that influence a personâ€™s selection for a particular job role.
